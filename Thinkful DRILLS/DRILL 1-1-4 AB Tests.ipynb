    "_In order to test for the potency of a sleep supplements effectiveness, I would implement my __\"two versions\"__ which would be the control (something already in use) and my test version. My test version would be the new supplement. I would have __\"sampling\"__ done by selecting two groups with almost exact parameters for my data. I would ensure that the __\"other measured variables\"__ are as close to exact as possible that way my data cannot be skewed in one direction or the other. Furthermore, before conducting any test/sample/experiment for data analysis, I would come up with a sound __\"hypothesis\"__ on what I __THINK__ the __\"outcome\"__ will be. Following my hypothesis, I will measure the outcome and determine what key metric influenced the data to be presented from the analysis on whether the new supplement was effective or not._\n"

I would gather the data from the old webpage and then set up a sample for 90 days to gather information on traffic flow, clicks, or any other pertinent information needed to determine if a hypothesis was correct. This would help determine my next steps and outcomes. A key difference would be the measure variables as a NEW webpage will alter some of the variables.
