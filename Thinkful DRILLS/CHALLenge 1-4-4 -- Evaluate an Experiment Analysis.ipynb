    "*__1) The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.__*\n",
    "\n",
    "_The flaw in this statement is that droids are programmed and dont generally feel one side or the other. They do what they are programmed to do. Hence, they would feel neutral on either slogan. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I will get into the bias..._\n",
    "\n",
    "_The bias (other than them being droids) is that if they were FEELING beings, that they would lean more towards the person who has a greater position of power, which would be the emperor. To fix this, I would have the messages delievered to imperial troops in a blind message forum._\n",
    "\n",
    "_P.S. There are only two Sith ever at any given time due to the rule of two started by Darth Bane. They would not be recruiting more Sith because there are none. Moreover, the slogan would be the incorrect slogan to recruit more troops to fulfill the imperial army._"

    "*__2) In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.__*\n",

She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.__*\n",

There are multiple reasons as to why it is skewed but the main reason that jumps to me is that she didnt randomize the stacks of tests or give the tests to every other student in some ordered fashion to randomize it.
